Rising SAR

Prior SAR: The SAR value for the previous period.

Extreme Point (EP): The highest high of the current uptrend.

Acceleration Factor (AF): Starting at .02, AF increases by .02 each
time the extreme point makes a new high. AF can reach a maximum
of .20, no matter how long the uptrend extends.

Current SAR = Prior SAR + Prior AF(Prior EP - Prior SAR)
13-Apr-10 SAR = 48.28 = 48.13 + .14(49.20 - 48.13)

The Acceleration Factor is multiplied by the difference between the
Extreme Point and the prior period's SAR. This is then added to the
prior period's SAR. Note however that SAR can never be above the
prior two periods' lows. Should SAR be above one of those lows, use
the lowest of the two for SAR.

Falling SAR

Prior SAR: The SAR value for the previous period.

Extreme Point (EP): The lowest low of the current downtrend.

Acceleration Factor (AF): Starting at .02, AF increases by .02 each
time the extreme point makes a new low. AF can reach a maximum
of .20, no matter how long the downtrend extends.

Current SAR = Prior SAR - Prior AF(Prior SAR - Prior EP)
9-Feb-10 SAR = 43.56 = 43.84 - .16(43.84 - 42.07)

The Acceleration Factor is multiplied by the difference between the
Prior period's SAR and the Extreme Point. This is then subtracted
from the prior period's SAR. Note however that SAR can never be
below the prior two periods' highs. Should SAR be below one of
those highs, use the highest of the two for SAR.

# Directional Movement indicators
'''
Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength without regard to trend direction.
Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI), complement ADX by defining trend direction.

Directional movement is positive (plus) when the current high minus the prior high is greater than the prior low minus the current low. This so-called Plus Directional Movement (+DM) then equals the current high minus the prior high, provided it is positive. A negative value would simply be entered as zero.

Directional movement is negative (minus) when the prior low minus the current low is greater than the current high minus the prior high. This so-called Minus Directional Movement (-DM) equals the prior low minus the current low, provided it is positive. A negative value would simply be entered as zero.

1. Calculate the True Range (TR), Plus Directional Movement (+DM) and Minus Directional Movement (-DM) for each period.

2. Smooth these periodic values using the Wilder's smoothing techniques. These are explained in detail in the next section.

3. Divide the 14-day smoothed Plus Directional Movement (+DM) by the 14-day smoothed True Range to find the 14-day Plus Directional Indicator (+DI14). Multiply by 100 to move the decimal point two places. This +DI14 is the Plus Directional Indicator (green line) that is plotted along with ADX.

4. Divide the 14-day smoothed Minus Directional Movement (-DM) by the 14-day smoothed True Range to find the 14-day Minus Directional Indicator (-DI14). Multiply by 100 to move the decimal point two places. This -DI14 is the Minus Directional Indicator (red line) that is plotted along with ADX.

5. The Directional Movement Index (DX) equals the absolute value of +DI14 less - DI14 divided by the sum of +DI14 and - DI14.

6. After all these steps, it is time to calculate the Average Directional Index (ADX). The first ADX value is simply a 14-day average of DX. Subsequent ADX values are smoothed by multiplying the previous 14-day ADX value by 13, adding the most recent DX value and dividing this total by 14.
'''
'''
a strong trend is present when ADX is above 25 and no trend is present when below 20.
A buy signal occurs when ADX is above 20(25) and +DI crosses above -DI
A buy signal occurs when ADX is above 20(25) and -DI crosses above +DI

# Stochastic Oscillator

%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low)/(Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
%D = 3-day SMA of %K

Lowest Low = lowest low for the look-back period
Highest High = highest high for the look-back period
%K is multiplied by 100 to move the decimal point two places

Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that shows the location of the close relative to the high-low range over a set number of periods.

Stochastic Oscillator “doesn't follow price, it doesn't follow volume or anything like that. It follows the speed or the momentum of price. As a rule, the momentum changes direction before price.” As such, bullish and bearish divergences in the Stochastic Oscillator can be used to foreshadow reversals. This was the first, and most important, signal that Lane identified. Lane also used this oscillator to identify bull and bear set-ups to anticipate a future reversal. Because the Stochastic Oscillator is range bound, is also useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.

===

The KDJ indicator is actually a derived form of the Stochastic with the only difference being an extra line called the J line.

The J line represents the divergence of the %D value from the %K. The value of J can go beyond [0, 100] for %K and %D lines on the chart.

%K = 100 * (Close-LowestLow[last n periods])/(HighestHigh[last n periods]-LowestLow[last n periods])
%D = MovingAverage(%K)

CCI = (Typical Price  -  20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 x Mean Deviation)

Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3

Constant = .015

MD = MA(|TP - MA(TP, N)|, N)

There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation.
First, subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price.
Second, take the absolute values of these numbers.
Third, sum the absolute values.
Fourth, divide by the total number of periods (20).

CCI is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.
CCI measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time.
CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average.
CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average.
CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.

RSI = 100 - --------
             1 + RS

RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

The very first calculations for average gain and average loss are simple 14 period averages.

    First Average Gain = Sum of Gains over the past 14 periods / 14.
    First Average Loss = Sum of Losses over the past 14 periods / 14

The second, and subsequent, calculations are based on the prior averages and the current gain loss:

    Average Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14.
    Average Loss = [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14.

RSI calculation is based on 14 periods
RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30
RSI tends to fluctuate between 40 and 90 in a bull market (uptrend) with the 40-50 zones acting as support.
RSI tends to fluctuate between 10 and 60 in a bear market (downtrend) with the 50-60 zone acting as resistance.
RSI is an extremely popular momentum indicator

ATR is an indicator that measures volatility.

Current ATR = [(Prior ATR x 13) + Current TR] / 14

  - Multiply the previous 14-day ATR by 13.
  - Add the most recent day's TR value.
  - Divide the total by 14

True Range (TR), which is defined as the greatest of the following:

    Method 1: Current High less the current Low
    Method 2: Current High less the previous Close (absolute value)
    Method 3: Current Low less the previous Close (absolute value)

If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range. This is an outside day that would use Method 1 to calculate the TR. This is pretty straight forward.
Methods 2 and 3 are used when there is a gap or an inside day.
A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high (signaling a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than the current low (signaling a potential gap up or limit move).
